This project is about reconstructing curves (boundaries of 2D images) from intersections of cutting lines with the boundary of the image. It is a signed distance based reconstruction where we are given the signed distance data on the cutting lines and we are using the Hermite interpolation to interpolate this data inside. 
First, we consider the partitioning of the bounding box into convex polygons by cutting lines and then using the transfinite mean value interpolation to interpolate the signed distance data inside the polygon. 
Then we are using the marching triangles algorithm to extarct the zero level set.
